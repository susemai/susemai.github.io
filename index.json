One of the major challenges of PIM architectures in the scope of Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference is the implementation of area-intensive Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units in memory technologies, especially for DRAM-based PIMs. The DRAM architecture restricts the integration of DNN computation units near the area optimized commodity DRAM Sub-Array (SA) or Primary Sense Amplifier (PSA) region, where the data parallelism is maximum and the data movement cost is minimum. In this paper, we present a novel DRAM-based PIM architecture that is based on bit-decomposed MAC operation and Weighted Current Summation (WCS) technique to implement the MAC unit with minimal additional circuitry in the PSA region by leveraging on mixed-signal design. The architecture presents a two-stage design that employs light-weight current mirror based analog units near the SAs in the PSA region, whereas all the other substantial logic is integrated near the bank peripheral region. Hence, our architecture attains a balance between the data parallelism, data movement energy and area optimization. For an 8-bit CNN inference, our novel 8Gb DRAM PIM device achieves a peak performance of 142.8GOPS while consuming a power of 756.76mW, which results in an energy efficiency of 188.8GOPS/W. The area overhead of such an 8Gb device for a 2ynm DRAM technology is 12.63% in comparison to a commodity 8Gb DRAM device.","tags":null,"title":"A Weighted Current Summation Based Mixed Signal DRAM-PIM Architecture for Deep Neural Network Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://example.com/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://example.com/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"966620e3614cf3db7d899931378377d5","permalink":"https://example.com/partners/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/partners/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Partners","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://example.com/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"838c685a06099730b5bb6f60c9262361","permalink":"https://example.com/workpackage/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workpackage/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Workpackage","type":"widget_page"}]
