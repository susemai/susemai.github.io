However, creating an atlas from these volumes requires accurate organ segmentation. In the last decade, machine learning approaches have achieved incredible results in image segmentation tasks, but they require large amounts of annotated data for training. In this paper, we propose a self-training framework for multi-organ segmentation in tomographic images of Medaka fish. We utilize the pseudo-labeled data from a pretrained Teacher model and adopt a Quality Classifier to refine the pseudo-labeled data. Then, we introduce a pixel-wise knowledge distillation method to prevent overfitting to the pseudo-labeled data and improve the segmentation performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves mean Intersection over Union (IoU) by 5.9% on the full dataset and enables keeping the quality while using three times less markup.","tags":null,"title":"A Knowledge Distillation framework for Multi-Organ Segmentation of Medaka Fish in Tomographic Image","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katharina Bendig","René Schuster","Didier Stricker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677196800,"objectID":"5232605fd8d0f386a07cf71c4ddd2200","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/on-the-future-of-training-spiking-neural-networks/","publishdate":"2023-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/on-the-future-of-training-spiking-neural-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"Spiking Neural Networks have obtained a lot of attention in recent years due to their close depiction of brain functionality as well as their energy efficiency.

Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved significant improvement in the HAR field with the development of human–computer interaction applications. However, most of them are limited to operating in a local neighborhood in the process of a standard convolution neural network, and correlations between different sensors on body positions are ignored. In addition, even though several recent existing works considered the correlations between different sensor positions, they still face significant challenging problems with performance degradation due to large gaps in the distribution of training and test data, and behavioral differences between subjects. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer-based Adversarial learning framework for human activity recognition using wearable sensors via Self-KnowledgE Distillation (TASKED), that accounts for individual sensor orientations and spatial and temporal features. The proposed method is capable of learning cross-domain embedding feature representations from multiple subjects datasets using adversarial learning and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) regularization to align the data distribution over multiple domains. In the proposed method, we adopt the teacher-free self-knowledge distillation to improve the stability of the training procedure and the performance of human activity recognition. Experimental results show that TASKED not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the four real-world public HAR datasets (alone or combined) but also improves the subject generalization effectively.","tags":null,"title":"TASKED: Transformer-based Adversarial learning for human activity recognition using wearable sensors via Self-KnowledgE Distillation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chirag Sudarshan","Mohammad Hassani Sadi","Christian Weis","Norbert Wehn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668124800,"objectID":"0889bba8818f43d58b3fa02ed63d3e42","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/optimization-of-dram-based-pim-architecture-for-energy-efficient-deep-neural-network-training/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/optimization-of-dram-based-pim-architecture-for-energy-efficient-deep-neural-network-training/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep Neural Network (DNN) training consumes high-energy. On the other hand, DNNs deployed on edge devices demand very high-energy efficiency. In this context, Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is an emerging compute paradigm that bridges the memory-computation gap to improve the energy-efficiency. DRAMs are one such memory type employed for designing energy-efficient PIM architectures for DNN training. One of the major issues of DRAM-PIM architectures designed for DNN training is the high number of internal data accesses within a bank between the memory arrays and the PIM computation units (e.g. 51% more than inference). These internal data accesses in the state-of-the-art DRAM PIM architectures consume very high energy compared to computation units. Hence, it is important to reduce the internal data access energy within the DRAM bank for further improving the energy efficiency of DRAMPIM architectures. We present three novel optimizations that together reduce the internal data access energy up to 81.54%. Our first optimization modifies the bank data access circuit to enable partial accesses of data instead of the conventional fixed granularity accesses, thereby exploiting the available sparsity during training. The second optimization is to have a dedicated low-energy region within the DRAM bank that has low capacitive load of global wires and shorter data movement. Finally, we propose a 12-bit high dynamic range floating-point format called TinyFloat that reduces the total number of data access energy by 20% compared to IEEE 754 half and single precision.","tags":null,"title":"Optimization of DRAM based PIM Architecture for Energy-Efficient Deep Neural Network Training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vitor Fortes Rey","Sungho Suh","Paul Lukowicz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664841600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664841600,"objectID":"4992fde4519ae1f3783132f346479a86","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/learning-from-the-best/","publishdate":"2022-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/learning-from-the-best/","section":"publication","summary":"We address the well-known wearable activity recognition problem of having to work with sensors that are non-optimal in terms of information they provide but have to be used due to wearability/usability concerns (e.g. the need to work with wrist-worn IMUs because they are embedded in most smart watches). To mitigate this problem we propose a method that facilitates the use of information from sensors that are only present during the training process and are unavailable during the later use of the system. The method transfers information from the source sensors to the latent representation of the target sensor data through contrastive loss that is combined with the classification loss during joint training. We evaluate the method on the well-known PAMAP2 and Opportunity benchmarks for different combinations of source and target sensors showing average (over all activities) F1 score improvements of between 5% and 13% with the improvement on individual activities, particularly well suited to benefit from the additional information going up to between 20% and 40%.","tags":null,"title":"Learning from the Best: Contrastive Representations Learning Across Sensor Locations for Wearable Activity Recognitiony","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chirag Sudarshan","Taha Soliman","Thomas Kämpfe","Christian Weis","Norbert Wehn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664755200,"objectID":"ea0a695520fd423e96956c8fc4cf4c76","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/fefet-versus-dram-based-pim-architectures/","publishdate":"2022-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fefet-versus-dram-based-pim-architectures/","section":"publication","summary":"The throughput and energy efficiency of compute-centric architectures for memory intensive Deep Neural Networks (DNN) applications are limited by memory bound issues like high data-access energy, long latencies, and limited bandwidth.

PIM places computational logic inside the memory to exploit minimum data movement and massive internal data parallelism. There are currently two PIM trends: 1) Use of emerging non-volatile memories to perform highly parallel analog computation of MAC operations and implicit storage of weights within the memory arrays, and 2) exploiting mature memory technologies that are enhanced by additional logic to enable efficient computation of MAC operations near the memory arrays. In this paper, we will compare both trends from an architectural perspective. Our study mainly emphasizes on FeFET memories (an emerging memory candidate) and DRAM memories (a mature memory candidate).

One of the major challenges of PIM architectures in the scope of Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference is the implementation of area-intensive Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units in memory technologies, especially for DRAM-based PIMs. The DRAM architecture restricts the integration of DNN computation units near the area optimized commodity DRAM Sub-Array (SA) or Primary Sense Amplifier (PSA) region, where the data parallelism is maximum and the data movement cost is minimum. In this paper, we present a novel DRAM-based PIM architecture that is based on bit-decomposed MAC operation and Weighted Current Summation (WCS) technique to implement the MAC unit with minimal additional circuitry in the PSA region by leveraging on mixed-signal design. The architecture presents a two-stage design that employs light-weight current mirror based analog units near the SAs in the PSA region, whereas all the other substantial logic is integrated near the bank peripheral region. Hence, our architecture attains a balance between the data parallelism, data movement energy and area optimization. For an 8-bit CNN inference, our novel 8Gb DRAM PIM device achieves a peak performance of 142.8GOPS while consuming a power of 756.76mW, which results in an energy efficiency of 188.8GOPS/W. The area overhead of such an 8Gb device for a 2ynm DRAM technology is 12.63% in comparison to a commodity 8Gb DRAM device.","tags":null,"title":"A Weighted Current Summation Based Mixed Signal DRAM-PIM Architecture for Deep Neural Network Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://example.com/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"966620e3614cf3db7d899931378377d5","permalink":"https://example.com/partners/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/partners/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Partners","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://example.com/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"838c685a06099730b5bb6f60c9262361","permalink":"https://example.com/workpackage/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workpackage/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Workpackage","type":"widget_page"}]
