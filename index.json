Existing methods often struggle to balance the trade-off between image quality, especially in high-frequency details, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel Diffusion-Wavelet (DiWa) approach for bridging this gap. It leverages the strengths of diffusion models and discrete wavelet transformation. By enabling the diffusion model to operate in the frequency domain, our models effectively hallucinate highfrequency information for SR images on the wavelet spectrum, resulting in high-quality and detailed reconstructions in image space. Quantitatively, our method outperforms other state-ofthe-art diffusion-based SR methods, namely SR3 and SRDiff, regarding PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on both face (8x scaling) and general (4x scaling) SR benchmarks. Meanwhile, using the frequency domain allows us to use fewer parameters than the compared models: 92M parameters instead of 550M compared to SR3 and 9.3M instead of 12M compared to SRDiff.

The prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient operation, as well as reducing maintenance costs. However, determining the life cycle of batteries in real-world scenarios is challenging, and existing methods have limitations in predicting the number of cycles iteratively. In addition, existing works often oversimplify the datasets, neglecting important features of the batteries such as temperature, internal resistance, and material type. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a two-stage RUL prediction scheme for Lithium-ion batteries using a spatio-temporal multimodal attention network (ST-MAN). The proposed ST-MAN is to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the battery data, including the features that are often neglected in existing works. Despite operating without prior knowledge of end-of-life (EOL) events, our method consistently achieves lower error rates, boasting mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.0275 and 0.0014, respectively, compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based methods. The proposed method has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of battery operations and is applicable in various industries.","tags":null,"title":"Remaining useful life prediction of Lithium-ion batteries using spatio-temporal multimodal attention networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karen Joisten"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1723420800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723420800,"objectID":"7ef7ece198df8549d23985e50cac10f9","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/selbstverstandlich-digital/","publishdate":"2024-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/selbstverstandlich-digital/","section":"publication","summary":"Der vorliegende Sammelband versammelt aus philosophischer und ethischer Perspektive unterschiedliche Beiträge, die sich mit dem Einfluss des Digitalen auf das Selbstverständnis des Menschen, seinen Umgang mit dem Mitmenschen und dessen Auswirkungen auf die Lebenswirklichkeit auseinandersetzen.

The manufacturing environment generates massive amounts of unlabeled data on a daily basis, with only a few instances of abnormal data occurrences. This leads to severe data imbalance. Thus, creating well-balanced datasets is not straightforward due to the high costs associated with labeling. Nonetheless, this is a crucial step for enhancing productivity.

ContextMix generates novel data by resizing entire images and integrating them into other images within the batch. This approach enables our method to learn discriminative features based on varying sizes from resized images and train informative secondary features for object recognition using occluded images. With the minimal additional computation cost of image resizing, ContextMix enhances performance compared to existing augmentation techniques.

However, low-bit-width data formats suffer from a limited dynamic range, resulting in reduced accuracy. In this paper, a novel 8-bit Floating Point (FP8) data format quantized DNN training methodology is presented, which adapts to the required dynamic range on-the-fly. Our methodology relies on varying the bias values of FP8 format to fit the dynamic range to the required range of DNN parameters and input feature maps. The range fitting during the training is adaptively performed by an online statistical analysis hardware unit without stalling the computation units or its data accesses. Our approach is compatible with any DNN compute cores without any major modifications to the architecture. We propose to integrate the new FP8 quantization unit in the memory controller. The FP32 data from the compute core are converted to FP8 in the memory controller before writing to the DRAM and converted back after reading the data from DRAM. Our results show that the DRAM access energy is reduced by 3.07 while using an 8-bit data format instead of using 32-bit.

Manual inspection by trained personnel is carried out to inspect the disease spread and extent of damage to wheat fields. However, this is quite inefficient, time-consuming, and laborious, owing to the large area of wheat plantations. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) offer efficient and accurate solutions to such real-world problems. By analyzing large amounts of data, AI algorithms can identify patterns that are difficult for humans to detect, enabling early disease detection and prevention. However, deep learning models are data-driven, and scarcity of data related to specific crop diseases is one major hindrance in developing models. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we introduce an annotated real-world semantic segmentation dataset named the NUST Wheat Rust Disease (NWRD) dataset. Multileaf images from wheat fields under various illumination conditions with complex backgrounds were collected, preprocessed, and manually annotated to construct a segmentation dataset specific to wheat stripe rust disease. Classification of WRD into different types and categories is a task that has been solved in the literature; however, semantic segmentation of wheat crops to identify the specific areas of plants and leaves affected by the disease remains a challenge. For this reason, in this work, we target semantic segmentation of WRD to estimate the extent of disease spread in wheat fields. Sections of fields where the disease is prevalent need to be segmented to ensure that the sick plants are quarantined and remedial actions are taken. This will consequently limit the use of harmful fungicides only on the targeted disease area instead of the majority of wheat fields, promoting environmentally friendly and sustainable farming solutions. Owing to the complexity of the proposed NWRD segmentation dataset, in our experiments, promising results were obtained using the UNet semantic segmentation model and the proposed adaptive patching with feedback (APF) technique, which produced a precision of 0.506, recall of 0.624, and F1 score of 0.557 for the rust class.","tags":null,"title":"The NWRD Dataset: An Open-Source Annotated Segmentation Dataset of Diseased Wheat Crop","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyungmin Kim","Sungho Suh","Daehwan Kim","Daun Jeong","Hansang Cho","Junmo Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689811200,"objectID":"aaa5529779ff317c369fe5bbe4e165c6","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/proxy-anchor-based-unsupervised-learning-for-continuous-generalized-category-discovery/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/proxy-anchor-based-unsupervised-learning-for-continuous-generalized-category-discovery/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of various computer vision applications.

To address the limitations and more accurately reflect real-world scenarios, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised class incremental learning approach for discovering novel categories on unlabeled sets without prior knowledge.

To address this problem, virtual try-on systems have been developed to provide customers with a more realistic and personalized way to try on clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual try-on method called ClothFit, which can predict the draping shape of a garment on a target body based on the actual size of the garment and human attributes. Unlike existing try-on models, ClothFit considers the actual body proportions of the person and available cloth sizes for clothing virtualization, making it more appropriate for current online apparel outlets. The proposed method utilizes a U-Net-based network architecture that incorporates cloth and human attributes to guide the realistic virtual try-on synthesis. Specifically, we extract features from a cloth image using an auto-encoder and combine them with features from the users height, weight, and cloth size. The features are concatenated with the features from the U-Net encoder, and the U-Net decoder synthesizes the final virtual try-on image. Our experimental results demonstrate that ClothFit can significantly improve the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of photo-realistic virtual try-on results.","tags":null,"title":"ClothFit: Cloth-Human-Attribute Guided Virtual Try-On Network Using 3D Simulated Dataset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Octavio Arriaga","Sebastian Palacio","Matias Valdenegro-Toro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1685750400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685750400,"objectID":"4987f438a317ea777e635b4565a1e3c9","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/difficulty-estimation-with-action-scores-for-computer-vision-tasks/","publishdate":"2023-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/difficulty-estimation-with-action-scores-for-computer-vision-tasks/","section":"publication","summary":"As more machine learning models are now being applied in real world scenarios it has become crucial to evaluate their difficulties and biases.

Predicting the naphtha composition accurately is crucial for efficiently controlling the cracking process and achieving maximum performance. Traditional methods, such as gas chromatography and true boiling curve, are not feasible due to the need for pilot-plant-scale experiments or cost constraints. In this paper, we propose a neural network framework that utilizes chemical property information to improve the performance of naphtha composition prediction. Our proposed framework comprises two parts: a Watson K factor estimation network and a naphtha composition prediction network. Both networks share a feature extraction network based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, while the output layers use Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based networks to generate two different outputs - Watson K factor and naphtha composition. The naphtha composition is expressed in percentages, and its sum should be 100%. To enhance the naphtha composition prediction, we utilize a distillation simulator to obtain the distillation curve from the naphtha composition, which is dependent on its chemical properties. By designing a loss function between the estimated and simulated Watson K factors, we improve the performance of both Watson K estimation and naphtha composition prediction.

Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved significant improvement in the HAR field with the development of human–computer interaction applications. However, most of them are limited to operating in a local neighborhood in the process of a standard convolution neural network, and correlations between different sensors on body positions are ignored. In addition, even though several recent existing works considered the correlations between different sensor positions, they still face significant challenging problems with performance degradation due to large gaps in the distribution of training and test data, and behavioral differences between subjects. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer-based Adversarial learning framework for human activity recognition using wearable sensors via Self-KnowledgE Distillation (TASKED), that accounts for individual sensor orientations and spatial and temporal features. The proposed method is capable of learning cross-domain embedding feature representations from multiple subjects datasets using adversarial learning and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) regularization to align the data distribution over multiple domains. In the proposed method, we adopt the teacher-free self-knowledge distillation to improve the stability of the training procedure and the performance of human activity recognition. Experimental results show that TASKED not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the four real-world public HAR datasets (alone or combined) but also improves the subject generalization effectively.","tags":null,"title":"TASKED: Transformer-based Adversarial learning for human activity recognition using wearable sensors via Self-KnowledgE Distillation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chirag Sudarshan","Mohammad Hassani Sadi","Christian Weis","Norbert Wehn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668124800,"objectID":"0889bba8818f43d58b3fa02ed63d3e42","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/optimization-of-dram-based-pim-architecture-for-energy-efficient-deep-neural-network-training/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/optimization-of-dram-based-pim-architecture-for-energy-efficient-deep-neural-network-training/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep Neural Network (DNN) training consumes high-energy.

In this context, Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is an emerging compute paradigm that bridges the memory-computation gap to improve the energy-efficiency. DRAMs are one such memory type employed for designing energy-efficient PIM architectures for DNN training. One of the major issues of DRAM-PIM architectures designed for DNN training is the high number of internal data accesses within a bank between the memory arrays and the PIM computation units (e.g. 51% more than inference). These internal data accesses in the state-of-the-art DRAM PIM architectures consume very high energy compared to computation units. Hence, it is important to reduce the internal data access energy within the DRAM bank for further improving the energy efficiency of DRAMPIM architectures. We present three novel optimizations that together reduce the internal data access energy up to 81.54%. Our first optimization modifies the bank data access circuit to enable partial accesses of data instead of the conventional fixed granularity accesses, thereby exploiting the available sparsity during training. The second optimization is to have a dedicated low-energy region within the DRAM bank that has low capacitive load of global wires and shorter data movement. Finally, we propose a 12-bit high dynamic range floating-point format called TinyFloat that reduces the total number of data access energy by 20% compared to IEEE 754 half and single precision.","tags":null,"title":"Optimization of DRAM based PIM Architecture for Energy-Efficient Deep Neural Network Training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vitor Fortes Rey","Sungho Suh","Paul Lukowicz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664841600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664841600,"objectID":"4992fde4519ae1f3783132f346479a86","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/learning-from-the-best/","publishdate":"2022-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/learning-from-the-best/","section":"publication","summary":"We address the well-known wearable activity recognition problem of having to work with sensors that are non-optimal in terms of information they provide but have to be used due to wearability/usability concerns (e.g. the need to work with wrist-worn IMUs because they are embedded in most smart watches). To mitigate this problem we propose a method that facilitates the use of information from sensors that are only present during the training process and are unavailable during the later use of the system.

PIM places computational logic inside the memory to exploit minimum data movement and massive internal data parallelism.

One of the major challenges of PIM architectures in the scope of Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference is the implementation of area-intensive Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units in memory technologies, especially for DRAM-based PIMs. The DRAM architecture restricts the integration of DNN computation units near the area optimized commodity DRAM Sub-Array (SA) or Primary Sense Amplifier (PSA) region, where the data parallelism is maximum and the data movement cost is minimum. In this paper, we present a novel DRAM-based PIM architecture that is based on bit-decomposed MAC operation and Weighted Current Summation (WCS) technique to implement the MAC unit with minimal additional circuitry in the PSA region by leveraging on mixed-signal design. The architecture presents a two-stage design that employs light-weight current mirror based analog units near the SAs in the PSA region, whereas all the other substantial logic is integrated near the bank peripheral region. Hence, our architecture attains a balance between the data parallelism, data movement energy and area optimization. For an 8-bit CNN inference, our novel 8Gb DRAM PIM device achieves a peak performance of 142.8GOPS while consuming a power of 756.76mW, which results in an energy efficiency of 188.8GOPS/W.
