Jörn Hees studied computer science at the H-BRS (Bachelor) and at the TU Kaiserslautern (Master & PhD program), always with a strong interest in AI. In his doctoral thesis "Simulating Human Associations with Linked Data" at the intersection of psychology, knowledge graphs, data mining and machine learning, he analyzed large knowledge graphs in order to be able to understand an important part of human thinking, namely the association (dog - cat).
